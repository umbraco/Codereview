```markdown
### Environment Information:
**Umbraco:** 12.2.0  
**Forms:** 12.1.1  
**Deploy:** 4.6.2  
**Installed Packages:**  
- SEO Toolkit 1.5.3  
- uSync 9.6.0

---

### Code For Review (Files & Lines Involved)
- `Controllers/ContactFormController.cs:88â€“102`  
- `Views/Partials/Forms/ContactForm.cshtml:22â€“40`  
- `App_Plugins/CustomValidation/validation.js:14â€“22`

---

### Summary
We're encountering a validation issue with the contact form on our website. 
When users submit the form without filling all required fields, the form still appears to submit successfully, and the success message is shownâ€”despite no data being saved to the database.

---

### Expected Behavior
If required fields (like Name and Email) are left blank, the form should display inline error messages and **not** submit until all fields are valid.

---

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to `/contact-us`
2. Leave all fields empty
3. Click the "Submit" button
4. Observe that the form reloads with a success message, even though the required data is missing

---

### Additional Notes
- This issue started after upgrading from Umbraco Forms 11.x to 12.1.1.
- Client-side validation appears to be firing correctly (fields turn red), but server-side logic seems to be bypassed.
- We are using a custom controller for form submissions (`ContactFormController.cs`).
